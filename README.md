## üìä Project Overview

This research employs an integrated mixed-methods approach combining **Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA)**, **Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)**, and **Machine Learning** to examine structural determinants of Indigenous health disparities using Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) data (2015-2018). Grounded in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, this research addresses structural determinants of health through culturally safe methodologies.

**Key Findings**:
- **Unmet healthcare needs** identified as strongest predictor of Indigenous status (Gini importance = 223.3)
- **Random Forest accuracy**: 85.4% in distinguishing Indigenous vs non-Indigenous respondents
- **Clear predictor hierarchy**: Unmet needs > regular provider > healthcare access > diabetes > mental health
- **Divergent pathways**: 72% of mental health disparity mediated by healthcare access vs. diabetes showing direct historical trauma effects
- **Clear separation** between Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups in healthcare domain space
- Significant direct and mediated **pathways through healthcare access to health outcomes**

## üéØ Policy Relevance & Professional Alignment

The research integrates statistical sophistication with deep understanding of territorial political advocacy contexts, demonstrating how advanced analytics can serve Indigenous health sovereignty and evidence-based policy development. It emerges from direct experience with territorial political advocacy in Treaty 1, where evidence-based approaches are essential for advancing Indigenous health equity. The analytical framework arms territorial political organizations (SCO, MKO, AMC, MMF) to respond to longstanding advocacy priorities with the evidence-based insights that:

- **Center structural determinants** over individual risk factors based on empirical feature importance
- **Differentiate pathways** between diabetes (historical trauma) and mental health (healthcare access mediation)
- **Validate structural frameworks** for health equity advocacy through statistical triangulation
- **Support TRC Call to Action 19** implementation through data-driven approaches
- 
## üî¨ Analytical Approach

Developed through engagement with territorial health policy contexts, the integrated MFA‚ÜíSEM‚ÜíML workflow demonstrates how sophisticated statistical methods can serve Indigenous health advocacy by:

- Identifying **structural barrier hierarchies** for targeted intervention
- Quantifying healthcare access **mediation pathways**  
- Providing **empirical validation** for systemic reform priorities
- Offering **replicable methodology** for ongoing health equity monitoring
